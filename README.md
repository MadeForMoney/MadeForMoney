# Hi there, I'm Nithi 👋

### AI & Data Science Undergraduate | Research-oriented ML Engineer

I work on **Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP systems**, with a strong interest in  
**research-driven problem solving and end-to-end ML pipelines**.

> Turning data into understanding — and models into systems.

## 🔬 What I Work On

- **Computer Vision**
  - Anomaly Detection
  - Lightweight architectures & representation learning

- **NLP & RAG Systems**
  - PDF / CSV based Retrieval-Augmented Generation
  - FAISS, Pinecone, chunking, embeddings

- **ML Systems**
  - Pipeline design, evaluation, and ablation thinking
  - Bridging research ideas → deployable systems

- **Self-Evolving AI Systems**
  - Designed agents that iteratively improve outputs using feedback loops
  - Focus on autonomy, adaptation, and long-term performance improvement

- **End-to-End Predictive Systems**
  - Built and deployed an **F1 Race Outcome Predictor**
  - Covered the full pipeline: data ingestion → feature engineering → model training → deployment → inference

- **Responsible & Explainable AI**
  - Integrated explainability mechanisms into self-evolving AI systems
  - Used lightweight adaptation strategies (e.g., PEFT-style updates) to enable safe, controlled learning
  - Focused on transparency, stability, and preventing uncontrolled model drift

## ☕ Fun Facts

- I treat commit messages like tiny research notes.
- I enjoy reading papers more than model zoo repos.
- My browser tabs have ablations.
- I once debugged a bug caused by a *comment*. 😵
- I trust learning curves more than accuracy scores.
- I’ve broken models on purpose just to understand why they worked.
- I read architecture diagrams before reading conclusions.
- I care more about *failure cases* than perfect results.
- I believe a good baseline can be more impressive than a complex model.
